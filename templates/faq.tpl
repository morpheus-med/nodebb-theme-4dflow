  <p class='section strong highlight'>
    There is has been a lot of interest surrounding 4D Flow lately. What
    recent progress has been made?
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    There are a number of factors that have contributed to the recent uptick in 4D Flow interest. It
    used to be that Cardiac MRI was the only technique available and, due to the length of time and
    expertise required to perform, it was and still is very expensive, not to mention uncomfortable for
    the patient.
  </p>

  <p class='section'>
    What makes 4D Flow different and possible is you can now acquire everything needed for a
    comprehensive analysis in one rapid volume scan that takes less than 10 minutes to complete.
    By combining advances in parallel imaging,  motion correction, pulse sequences and computing
    technology, there is now a viable technique that can be deployed outside the research environment in
    a clinical, high-throughput setting.
  </p>

  <p class='section strong highlight'>
    Why has it taken so long for 4D Flow and Cardiac MRI to be adopted?
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    New techniques take time and the efforts of many to research and validate. With multiple studies and
    significant validation of 4D Flow documented in publications, the evidence is now there to support
    successful adoption. The field is growing. Through knowledge sharing, the technique will only continue
    to improve in its application and practice.
  </p>

  <p class='section strong highlight'>
    What are problems and challenges that cardiac imagers face and how does 4D Flow make Cardiac MRI a
    more viable clinical technique?    
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    Cardiac imagers, at least with respect to Cardiac MRI, have had to be specifically trained and at the
    MRI console for the duration of scanning to ensure successful data collection from the correct
    locations. 4D Flow relieves this burden by simplifying acquisition for the MR technologist and also
    for the patient by eliminating breath holding through improved motion correction and faster scanning.
    Resultant images are higher resolution, not blurry and in 3D with flow data in overlay.  The
    clinician may now focus on the patient and diagnosis now that acquisition intelligence is embedded
    within 4D Flow.
  </p>

  <p class='section strong highlight'>
    How does 4D Flow MRI compare with other modalities such as echocardiography, CT and diagnostic
    catheterization in assessing blood flow and cardiac function?
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    While 4D Flow is not a bedside modality, it has significant advantages in its ability to deliver
    high-resolution 3D images with accurate blood flow values, non-invasively and without radiation.
    With recent advances that have reduced scanning time by almost a factor of 10, this is a technique that
    is entering the mainstream to become a new gold standard. 
  </p>

  <p class='section strong highlight'>
    For valvular disease, does 4D Flow change the way conditions are managed and treated?
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    4D Flow is capable of more accurately staging valvular disease, for example, mitral valve regurgitation.
    While echocardiography may be able to detect the presence of regurgitation, it cannot accurately tell
    how much. Diagnostic catheterization is highly accurate but also very invasive and not without risk.
    With a 10 minute non-invasive scan, 4D Flow provides the required accuracy for staging disease and
    progression so that appropriate treatment plans may be prescribed.

    What special settings do I need to use on my MRI to obtain high resolution, high SNR and artifact-free
    studies?
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    When doing 4D Flow acquisitions, there are a few very important parameters to keep in mind.
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    First is the VENC or velocity encoding setting (in cm/sec). The higher the speed of blood flow,
    the higher the VENC you should use. VENC settings on neonates and pediatric patients are typically
    in the realm of 250 cm/sec and adult patients acquisitions can be done at VENCs in the range of 150
    cm/sec. Lower VENCs produce better Velocity to Noise ratios but there is a risk of velocity aliasing if
    too low a setting is used. 
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    If respiratory or EKG gating is being used, proper placement of the bellows or electrodes is
    important and MRI vendor specific. Be sure to follow all manufacturer recommendations. Some
    newer research pulse sequences require neither and rely instead on highly advanced motion
    correction algorithms.
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    There are other scan parameters that contribute to high quality acquisitions and with the growth of
    this field, the knowledge base is expanding and being shared. 
  </p>

  <p class='section strong highlight'>
    How long does it take to acquire, reconstruct and do post-processing on 4D Flow studies? 
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    It takes about 8-10 minutes to acquire and 20 minutes following scan completion for recon and
    post-processing. The latter is determined by computing platform capability.  
  </p>

  <h2 class='section'><a name="clinical"></a>Clinical</h2>
  
  <p class='section strong highlight'>
    How much training is required to perform 4D Flow successfully?
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    Very little training is required to perform successful 4D Flow scans.  Board certified
    radiologists determine diagnoses.
  </p>
  <p class='section strong highlight'>
    Do I need to have cardiac training?
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    Training is recommended but not essential if using 4D Flow, as the acquisition is so simple.
