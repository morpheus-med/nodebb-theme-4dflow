    Congenital heart disease is the number one birth defect (1% of all neonates). Due
    to the multiplicity of cases that can occur, an echocardiogram is often ill-equipped to
    accurately diagnose the patient condition.
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    Cardiac MRI with 4D Flow offers time resolved anatomical 3D images combined with accurate
    quantitative blood flow data,  enabling objective and precise disease diagnosis that leads
    to the establishment of appropriate treatment paths and meaningful comparative follow up.
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    <span class='highlight'>Pros:</span><br />
    &#8226; 10 minute scan<br />
    &#8226; Accurate flow data everywhere<br />
    &#8226; Simple
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    <span class='highlight'>Cons:</span><br />
    &#8226; Contrast agent suggested for best results<br />
    &#8226; Not a bedside technology

    Detection and assessment of valvular heart disease is an area of growing demand in healthcare.
    Ultrasound is the first line diagnostic tool and is effective at detecting extreme cases but lacks
    accuracy in intermediate cases and can also be highly technologist dependent.
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    A new alternative to highly invasive procedures like TEE or diagnostic catheterization is 4D Flow.
    In 10 to 20 minutes, this technique can offer accurate flow information to categorize and accurately stage
    valvular regurgitation as well as assess cardiac function.
  </p>

  <p class='section'>
    <span class='highlight'>Pros:</span><br />
    &#8226; Accurate flow,regurgitant fraction measures which enable accurate, objective diagnosis<br />
    &#8226; Quick (10 to 20 min) and simple
  </p>

  <p class='section'>
    <span class='highlight'>Cons:</span><br />
    &#8226; Contrast agent suggested for best results<br />
    &#8226; Contraindicated in patients with older generation of pacemakers and defibrillators<br />
    &#8226; Not a bedside technology
