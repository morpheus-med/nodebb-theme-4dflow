      4D Flow is a technology that enables the single sequence acquisition of time 
      resolved 3D anatomy combined with blood flow velocity in all 3 directions.
      Thus, 4D Flow can be thought of simply as:
    </p>
    <p>
      <center><b>3D Anatomy + Flow + Time = 4D Flow</b></center>
    </p>
    <p>
      By obtaining volume data from a region of interest, e.g. the whole heart, the
      cardiac radiologist is not required to spend hours at the scanner prescribing
      tedious planar acquisitions at highly specific locations on a moving object.
      A radiology technologist need only find the chest and launch the 4D Flow sequence
      to obtain a volumetric acquisition. 4D Flow has applications in quantifying 
      blood flow anywhere in the human body and within the limits of MRI resolution.
