      4D Flow is a technology that enables the single sequence acquisition of time 
      resolved 3D anatomy combined with blood flow velocity in all 3 directions.
      Thus, 4D Flow can be thought of simply as:
  </p>
  <p class='box section'>
    3D ANATOMY + FLOW + TIME = <span class='highlight'>4D FLOW</span>
  </p>
  <p class='section'>
    By obtaining volume data from a region of interest, e.g. the whole heart, the
    cardiac imager is not required to spend hours at the scanner prescribing
    tedious planar acquisitions at highly specific locations on a moving object.

    A radiology technologist need only find the chest and launch the 4D Flow sequence to
    obtain a volumetric acquisition. 4D Flow has applications in imaging and quantifying
    blood flow in the heart, brain, kidneys, liver - anywhere blood flow exists within the
    human body and within the limits of MRI resolution.
